# Solutions to Exercises

## For students of the Codecore Bootcamp

Each exercise is a separate commit.

So, `git log` will show you a list of the exercises, one per commit. To view one, `git checkout SHA` where `SHA` is the id  (example: `cdb98c5493c9494804e5056b0a2b49e738f431fc`) of the commit you want to view.
